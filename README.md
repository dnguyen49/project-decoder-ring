This project is designed to test your ability to build tricky algorithms as well as write unit tests with Mocha and Chai. Before taking on this module, you should be comfortable with the following:

    Installing packages via NPM
    Modifying the package.json file with new scripts
    Running tests from the command line
    Writing JavaScript functions
    Writing tests for specific functions
    Iterating through strings, objects, and arrays
    Debugging through reading errors and using the VSCode debugger

You will not need to make any edits to HTML or CSS for this project.
Project setup

Download the Qualified assessment files to your computer.

cd into the assessment folder.

Then, install dependencies locally by running the command:

npm i

To run the tests, you can run the following command:

npm test

To watch how the code you write affects the application website, you can run the following command. This command will start a server and take over your terminal window. To stop the server from running, you can press Control+C.

npm start

Instructions

You are tasked with building functions for an application that will either encode or decode a string using a variety of ciphers. For each cipher, you should make a series of tests using Mocha and Chai to confirm that your cipher works.

All of the functions can be found inside of the src/ directory. Each function and cipher is described below.

Below is a checklist of what you need to accomplish.

    [ ] Complete the caesar() function.
    [ ] Write tests for the caesar() function.
    [ ] Complete the polybius() function.
    [ ] Write tests for the polybius() function.
    [ ] Complete the substitution() function.
    [ ] Write tests for the substitution() function.
